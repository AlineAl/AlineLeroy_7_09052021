## 💾 Step by step

It was one of the most difficult projects I have had to do but also one of the most exciting. I decided to start with the backend with Sequelize, an ORM compatible with Node.js and MySQL. I was able to easily set up the models, the controllers as well as the migrations. This facilitated the creation of tables at the database level (mySQL). 

Regarding the frontend, I decided to use Vue.js which I had never used. It was very quick and easy to learn thanks to the documentation which is very well done. 

Finally, to make the link between the backend and the frontend, I used Axios working as a "fetch". I was thus able to easily make the link with the APIs while respecting the operations of the CRUD.

Thanks to this project I discovered the implementation of routes whether in backend or frontend. I was able to learn how to use Postman to test the backend routes and whether or not the CRUD works.

## 🔌 Points to improve

I would like to improve my application by setting up like and dislike, better creation of comments (other than with a for loop) and without going through another route. I would like to set up the possibility of putting an avatar for users. I would like to set up the possibility of putting an avatar for users. I could have thought of a way to designate another admin if the admin wants to delete their account.
